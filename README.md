# Animal Sounds

Flutter application for kids. It plays the sound that the displayed animal is making in real life.

The idea for the project came to me while doing the Flutter course by Angela Yu. It is based on the knowledge gained from [the Xylophone project.](https://github.com/londonappbrewery/xylophone-flutter)

Vectors used in this project are from [Vecteezy](https://www.vecteezy.com/)
Sounds are from [Freesound](https://freesound.org/)
